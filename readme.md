# Civic App Intro

The Civic App is based on an idea a friend and I had after the 2016 election when people felt angry but didnâ€™t know how to direct their energy, including us. We hypothesized that if people had a centralized place to find events related to issues they were passionate about, people would take action, and on a regular basis. 

# Tech Stack
Python, JavaScript(AJAX, JQuery), PostgreSQL, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

# APIs
Google Maps

# Features

I designed the functionality of this app to allow users to search for and save events as well as save their search criteria as preferences.


## Create An Account
Anyone can browse events, but in order to save events and filters, users need to create an account. During this process, they can choose any event categories they're interested in and they will be saved to their account.

## Apply Search Criteria 


## Save Filter


## Search by My Filters





## In Progress...

- Implementing Google Maps Direction API for a Search For Events Near Me feature
- Allowing user to create and name multiple filters as Views
